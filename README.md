# Gladys external integration — JavaScript template

Official starter template for building an **external integration** for
[Gladys Assistant](https://gladysassistant.com) with the JavaScript SDK
[`@gladysassistant/integration-sdk`](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/integration-sdk-js).

> Fork it, add the GitHub topic `gladys-assistant-integration`, push a
> multi-arch image, bump the version — that's publishing. No account, no review.

## What this template demonstrates

This is **not** a 40-line hello-world: it deliberately shows several **device
types** so you can copy the one closest to your hardware. Everything lives in
the [`src/devices/`](./src/devices) folder (one file per device type), and every
place where you would talk to your real hardware / cloud API is marked with a
`DO THE WORK` comment and a `logger` call.

| Device                 | Type illustrated                                                         | SDK hooks used                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Weather station        | Read-only sensors (temperature + humidity), **real data** via Open-Meteo | `onPoll`, `publishStates`, `onAction`       |
| Living room switch     | Binary actuator (ON/OFF)                                                 | `onSetValue`, `publishState`                |
| Living room light      | Dimmable light (on/off **+** brightness), `identify` action target       | `onSetValue` per feature, `identify`        |
| Office plug            | Mixed: actuator **+** power metering, transport badge **+ degraded**     | `onSetValue`, `onPoll`, `publishTransports` |
| Entrance motion sensor | Push / event-driven sensor                                               | `startPush`, `publishState`                 |
| Entrance camera        | Camera images: periodic snapshot **+** on-demand fresh capture           | `publishCameraImage`, `onGetImage`          |

The wiring (connection, auth, reconnection, dispatch) is in
[`index.js`](./index.js) — you rarely need to touch it.

```

To add a device type, create a new file in `src/devices/` following the same
shape as the existing ones, then register it in `src/devices/index.js`. Business
logic (the device modules) and utilities (`weather.js`, `config.js`) are kept
separate so the parts you edit stay small.

The plumbing you would otherwise copy into every integration comes straight
from the SDK (v0.13.0+):

- `logger` / `createLogger({ name })` — leveled console logger (`LOG_LEVEL`
  env var), with named/child loggers per module. Since SDK v0.4 the SDK also
  logs its own connection lifecycle (under the `gladys-sdk` name), so
  connectivity problems show up in `docker logs` without extra code;
- `DEVICE_FEATURE_CATEGORIES`, `DEVICE_FEATURE_TYPES`, `DEVICE_FEATURE_UNITS`
  — the standard Gladys categories / types / units, no manual string copying.
  The catalog grows with the SDK, so bumping the dependency is how you get the
  newest ones: `battery-storage`, `doorbell` and `water-valve` categories, the
  climate `fan-speed` / `swing-horizontal` / `swing-vertical` features and the
  `cubic-meter-per-hour` unit (SDK v0.10), then `charging-station` and
  `water-heater` categories plus the thermostat `mode` / `operating-state`
  features (SDK v0.11), then the `grid-sensor` / `home-output-sensor` /
  `maintenance` categories, the `no2` / `o3` / `so2` gas-concentration
  sensors, the camera PTZ features (`move` / `preset` / absolute positions),
  the solar `production` `power` feature and the dynamic `text` `select` type
  whose per-device choices live in `supported_options` (SDK v0.12), then the
  camera `enabled` feature (a Gladys-side privacy gate: `0` makes Gladys stop
  polling, streaming and serving the camera image without deleting the
  camera), the siren `alarm-mode` / `alarm-state` features and the battery
  `charging` binary sensor (SDK v0.13). A recent
  category only renders on a Gladys that knows it, so keep the manifest
  `gladys_version` range in sync with what you publish;
- `gladys.externalIds(type, platformId)` — builds the unique, stable device
  and feature external ids;
- `gladys.handleShutdown(cleanup)` — graceful SIGTERM/SIGINT handling;
- `gladys.setConnectionStatus(connected, message?)` — application-level
  connection status shown in the Configuration screen (the template reports it
  after every (re)initialization);
- `gladys.onAction(key, cb)` — handler of a manifest `actions` button: the
  template declares a `test_weather` action (manifest `actions` field) and the
  weather station blueprint implements it, returning the multi-language
  message displayed under the button;
- `gladys.publishCameraImage(externalId, image)` / `gladys.onGetImage(cb)`
  (SDK v0.5) — the camera image channel: push a periodic snapshot and answer
  on-demand capture requests with an `image/jpg;base64,...` string (≤ 150 KB,
  max 12 images/minute per device). Dedicated channel: images never go through
  the states history. See [`src/devices/camera.js`](./src/devices/camera.js);
- `gladys.publishTransports(entries)` + `DEVICE_TRANSPORTS` (SDK v0.5) — the
  per-device cloud/local transport badge for dual-channel devices. The
  manifest declares `"transports": ["local", "cloud"]`, so the Configuration
  screen shows a standard "Prefer the local connection" toggle whose value
  arrives as the reserved, read-only config key `GLADYS_PREFER_LOCAL`
  (boolean, default `true`). The demo plug applies the preference and reports
  its effective transport. Since SDK v0.7 an entry can also flag a
  **degraded** state (`{ degraded: true, message }`) — "it works, but not in
  the nominal mode": the demo plug uses it when local is preferred but the
  LAN session is refused, so the cloud fallback shows an orange dot with the
  reason instead of a silently normal badge. See
  [`src/devices/plug.js`](./src/devices/plug.js);
- dynamic device selects (SDK v0.7) — a manifest `select` field can replace
  its static `options` with `"source": "devices"`: the Configuration screen
  fills it with the integration's own created devices and the handler
  receives the chosen `external_id`. The template's `identify` action uses it
  to make the chosen device signal itself — the answer to "act on THIS
  device" without asking the user to copy an identifier;
- `section` config blocks + the Documentation link (SDK v0.8) — purely
  presentational intro blocks in the manifest `config_schema` (title,
  plain-text description, https links) for the onboarding guidance a compact
  form cannot carry; they store no value. For the long step-by-step, the
  Configuration screen shows a permanent **Documentation** link to the repo's
  [`docs/en.md`](./docs/en.md) / [`docs/fr.md`](./docs/fr.md), re-hosted by
  Gladys.

The SDK offers more for integrations that need it — OAuth2 cloud flows
(`onOAuthAuthorizeUrl` / `onOAuthCallback` + an `oauth2` config field, or the
`account_link` variant — SDK v0.12 — for providers that never redirect back:
QR sign-in approved in the vendor app, `redirectUri` undefined, no callback,
the integration polls the provider and reports through
`setConnectionStatus(true)`), sub-containers (`getContainers`, `startContainer`… + the manifest `containers`
field, whose published ports now come back as
`{ container_port, protocol, host_port, label, name, browsable }` — SDK v0.11,
`host_port` being the one Gladys allocated, `null` until it does, and `name`
what makes it referenceable in a manifest section text through the
`{{gladys_host}}` / `{{port:<name>}}` placeholders the frontend substitutes at
render time), mediated network discovery (`scanNetwork` + the manifest
`network_discovery` field, for UDP-broadcast / mDNS / SSDP scans from the
core — including the active query/response variant `udp-active-broadcast`,
SDK v0.7, where the integration forges the discovery request and the core
broadcasts it; since SDK v0.13 the results are precisely typed: an `mdns`
scan browses every declared entry and merges the results, and each `ssdp`
responder comes back as `{ source_ip, source_mac?, source_port, headers }`,
`source_mac` being a best-effort ARP-table lookup by the core — when present
it saves asking the user for a MAC before `wakeOnLan`), communication channels (manifest `type: "communication"`:
bidirectional Telegram-like bots linked by code — SDK v0.6,
`publishMessage` / `onSendMessage` / `linkContact` — and, since SDK v0.9,
send-only notification channels — `messaging: { receive: false }` plus a
manifest `contact_schema` describing the per-user credentials that
`onSendMessage(contact, message)` receives), and incoming webhooks relayed
by Gladys Plus (SDK v0.9: manifest `webhooks` field +
`getWebhooks` / `onWebhook` / `onWebhookUpdated`, for cloud services that
push their events Netatmo-style — the demo weather API only supports
polling, so the template does not declare any), Wake-on-LAN (SDK v0.12:
`wakeOnLan(mac, options?)` + the manifest `network_wake` field — the core,
which sits on the host network the bridge container cannot broadcast to,
builds and emits the standard magic packet itself, rate-limited to 1 wake
per 2 s per integration), and weather providers
(SDK v0.11: manifest `type: "weather"`, `onWeatherGet` answering with the
pivot weather format in the unit system the user asked for, plus the optional
`onWeatherGetImage` for a vigilance map or a rain radar and
`requestWeatherRefresh()` to nudge the core into re-pulling instead of waiting
for its 30-minute check. SDK v0.13 extends the pivot conditions enum with
`freezing-rain`, `freezing-fog`, `snow-thunderstorm`, `sandstorm`, `tornado`
and `hurricane` — keep sending the broader condition when your provider
cannot tell them apart. A provider feeds the dashboard widget and the chat
assistant, not devices, so it is a different integration type than this
template's `type: "device"`, even though the demo weather station here reads
the same kind of API). See the
[SDK README](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/integration-sdk-js) for those
patterns; this template stays focused on devices.

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
GLADYS_HOST_API_URL="http://localhost:1443" \
GLADYS_INTEGRATION_TOKEN="<token>" \
GLADYS_INTEGRATION_SELECTOR="demo-devices-template" \
LOG_LEVEL=debug \
npm start
```

The three `GLADYS_*` variables are injected by the Gladys supervisor when the
integration runs inside its sandboxed container. The SDK reads them
automatically.

## Quality checks

The template ships with the tooling every integration should keep. The same
three checks run automatically on every push and pull request (see
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)):

```bash
npm run format:check   # Prettier: is everything formatted?
npm run format         # Prettier: format everything in place
npm run lint           # ESLint: catch real mistakes (unused vars, dead code…)
npm test               # Unit tests, via the built-in `node --test` runner
```

Tests live in [`test/`](test/) and use Node's native test runner — no extra
test framework to install. Add a `*.test.js` file next to the ones already
there and it is picked up automatically.

## Validate before publishing

Before you tag a release, you can check that your integration passes the store
validation **locally**, without waiting for the hourly indexer. Run the store's
validator against your integration directory:

```bash
npx github:GladysAssistant/integration-store .
```

It runs the exact same checks as the store indexer — manifest JSON & schema,
Docker image availability (main and sub-containers), cover image (format,
dimensions, size) and the code rules — and reports **every** problem at once so
you can fix them in a single pass. It exits `0` when the integration is valid,
`1` otherwise. A few things can only be confirmed once the repository is public
(public repo, the `gladys-assistant-integration` topic, and the manifest sitting
at the root of the default branch), and the tool tells you which ones. See the
[integration store](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/integration-store) for
details.

## Publish in 5 steps

1. **Fork** this template (or use _Use this template_ on GitHub).
2. **Edit** the files in `src/devices/` and `gladys-assistant-integration.json` for your
   devices, and replace `docker_image` / `cover_image` with your own. Pick the
   manifest `categories` (Gladys 4.86+) your integration belongs to — 1 to 3
   keys among `climate`, `lighting`, `energy`, `security`, `multimedia`,
   `appliances`, `environment`, `protocols`, `network`, `notifications`,
   `assistants`, `services` — they are the catalog shelves the integration
   sits on (without them it only shows under "All" and in search). Declaring
   the field requires a `gladys_version` range starting at **4.86.0 or
   later** — older cores reject unknown manifest fields, and the store
   validator enforces the coupling. The template declares `lighting`,
   `security` and `environment` to match its demo devices.
3. **Add the GitHub topic** `gladys-assistant-integration` to your repo.
4. **Release from the GitHub UI**: open **Actions → Release → Run workflow**,
   pick `patch`, `minor` or `major`. The workflow bumps the version everywhere
   (`package.json` + manifest `version`/`docker_image`), pushes the `vX.Y.Z`
   tag, and builds the `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` image to `ghcr.io`
   (`:X.Y.Z` and `:latest`). No local tag, no manual version edit.
5. The decentralized indexer picks up the new manifest `version` and Gladys
   offers a one-click install / update.

> Prefer the terminal? `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags` still works — the
> hand-pushed tag triggers the same multi-arch build. This path only publishes
> the Docker tags, though: it does **not** touch `package.json`,
> `package-lock.json` or the manifest. Bump `version` (and `docker_image`) in
> `gladys-assistant-integration.json` and commit it **before** tagging, or the
> indexer will keep serving the old version. The Release workflow above does
> all of this for you.

## Notes

- Requires **Node.js ≥ 20** (uses the built-in global `fetch`; no HTTP dep).
- All external identifiers are prefixed with `ext:<selector>:` — always build
  them with `gladys.externalIds(type, platformId)` (or the lower-level
  `gladys.externalId(suffix)`); the server rejects anything else. Derive
  `platformId` from the unique id the external platform gives you (serial,
  cloud id, MAC…), never from a hard-coded label.
- `has_feedback: true` features should publish the state **confirmed by the
  device**; the template publishes the requested value for simplicity.
- Replace `cover.png` with your own 800×534 px image (≤150 KB, PNG or JPEG)
  before publishing. The bundled one is a plain gradient placeholder.
